To prevent this a player on the opposing team bats the ball up and toward a teammate before it touches the court surface—that teammate may then volley it back across the net or bat it to a third teammate who volleys it across the net. A team is allowed only three touches of the ball before it must be returned over the net.</p></div><div class='about-img'></div></div></div><!-- history --><!-- history --><!-- history --><!-- history --><!-- history --><!-- history --><!-- history --><div class='history'><h1>History</h1><div class='section-container'><div class='text'><p>Volleyball was invented in 1895 by William G. Morgan, physical director of the Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) in Holyoke, Massachusetts. It was designed as an indoor sport for businessmen who found the new game of basketball too vigorous. Morgan called the sport “mintonette,” until a professor from Springfield College in Massachusetts noted the volleying nature of play and proposed the name of “volleyball.” The original rules were written by Morgan and printed in the first edition of the Official Handbook of the Athletic League of the Young Men’s Christian Associations of North America (1897). The game soon proved to have wide appeal for both sexes in schools, playgrounds, the armed forces, and other organizations in the United States, and it was subsequently introduced to other countries.</p><p>In 1916 rules were issued jointly by the YMCA and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The first nationwide tournament in the United States was conducted by the National YMCA Physical Education Committee in New York City in 1922. The United States Volleyball Association (USVBA) was formed in 1928 and recognized as the rules-making, governing body in the United States. From 1928 the USVBA—now known as USA Volleyball (USAV)—has conducted annual national men’s and senior men’s (age 35 and older) volleyball championships, except during 1944 and 1945. Its women’s division was started in 1949, and a senior women’s division (age 30 and older) was added in 1977. Other national events in the United States are conducted by member groups of the USAV such as the YMCA and the NCAA.</p></div><div class='william-img'></div></div></div><!-- beach --><!-- beach --><!-- beach --><!-- beach --><!-- beach --><!-- beach --><!-- beach --><div class='beach'><h1>Beach</h1><div class='section-container'><div class='text'><p>Beach volleyball—usually played, as its name implies, on a sand court with two players per team—was introduced in California in 1930.

The main objective is to make it land inside the court; it is also desirable to set the ball's direction, speed and acceleration so that it becomes difficult for the receiver to handle it properly.A serve is called an 'ace' when the ball lands directly onto the court or travels outside the court after being touched by an opponent; when the only player on the server's team to touch the ball is the server.With serving there are two main types, the underhand serve and the overhand serve.</p></div><div class='serve-img'></div></div><h4>Pass</h4><div class='section-container'><div class='text'><p>Also called reception, the pass is the attempt by a team to properly handle the opponent's serve or any form of attack. Proper handling includes not only preventing the ball from touching the court but also making it reach the position where the setter is standing quickly and precisely.</p><p>The skill of passing involves fundamentally two specific techniques: underarm pass, or bump, where the ball touches the inside part of the joined forearms or platform, at waistline; and overhand pass, where it is handled with the fingertips, like a set, above the head.Either are acceptable in professional and beach volleyball; however, there are much tighter regulations on the overhand pass in beach volleyball.</p></div><div class='pass-img'></div></div><h4>Set</h4><div class='section-container'><div class='text'><p>The set is usually the second contact that a team makes with the ball.The main goal of setting is to put the ball in the air in such a way that it can be driven by an attack into the opponent's court.The setter coordinates the offensive movements of a team, and is the player who ultimately decides which player will actually attack the ball.</p><p>As with passing, one may distinguish between an overhand and a bump set. Since the former allows for more control over the speed and direction of the ball, the bump is used only when the ball is so low it cannot be properly handled with fingertips, or in beach volleyball where rules regulating overhand setting are more stringent. In the case of a set, one also speaks of a front or back set, meaning whether the ball is passed in the direction the setter is facing or behind the setter. There is also a jump set that is used when the ball is too close to the net. In this case, the setter usually jumps off their right foot straight up to avoid going into the net. The setter usually stands about ⅔ of the way from the left to the right of the net and faces the left (the larger portion of net that he or she can see).</p></div><div class='set-img'></div></div></div><!-- Rules --><!-- terms --><!-- terms --><!-- terms --><!-- terms --><!-- terms --><!-- terms --><div class='terms'><h1>Basic Volleyball Termsbd </h1><div class='section-container'><div class='text'><ul><li>6 players on the floor at any one time - 3 in the front row and 3 in the back row</li><li>Maximum of 3 hits per side</li><li>Points are made on every serve for wining team of rally (rally-point scoring).</li><li>Player may not hit the ball twice in succession.
